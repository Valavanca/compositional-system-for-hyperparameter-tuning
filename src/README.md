# Source code for multi objective optimization with components

## Structure:

- `.composite\` - folder with basic class, wrappers for providing advanced compositional architecture.
- `.plot\` - tools for plotting and evaluation models and results.
- `.solver\` - algorithms for searching global/local minimum on the model of search space.
- `.hypothesis\` - models that can extrapolate evaluated results to all search space.
