# Compositional Multi-objective parameter tuning

## 1. Introdaction

- Problem description and topic importance. Why we need multi-objective in parameter tuning?
- Presented products. Current solutions. Cons and pons. What is wrong?

## 2. Parameter tuning via model-based system

- Quality & Effort tradeoff for multi-objective
- Variability in restoring target objective
- Human in the loop: Why we need composition technic

## 3. Compositional approach

- Components as solids

    Motivation from the Dagster pipeline. Should look like solution for problem and as description for components.

- Compositional technic. Variability.

    Pipeline as compositional system. Possible use the sk-learn.

    In the and we need to rich compositional system with good models that can predict/tune feal parameters from plethora black-box problems with multi/many objectivity.

## 4. Evaluation

- No-free-lunch theorem: How much problems do we need?

    Background for reasoning to evaluate approaches in plethora problems. Different class problems.

- Proof of concept. Synthetic problems and there restoring from samples

    Math formulation and solving with multi-obj algorithm.
    ZDT and other problems from competitions. Scaling from 2-D to 35-D. This as basic play ground for 

- To take through its paces: physical evaluation
    - Sweat-spot problem
    - Kerbal Space Program. Tuning parameters for launch space rocket

## 5. Conclusion

    Show that compositional works
