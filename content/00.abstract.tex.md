Abstract
========

The goal of this thesis is to investigate if the performance of MOEAs
approach can be gain with less evalutions by using compositional
surrogates. The key idea of compositional surrogates is the splitting
objective space to multiple surrogates that extrapolate it
independently. Combination of multiple hypotheses should give them the
potential to approximate more complicated problems. This approach avoids
the idea of a single surrogate model, preferring instead to use the
composition hypothesis to split out the terrain of objective space.
