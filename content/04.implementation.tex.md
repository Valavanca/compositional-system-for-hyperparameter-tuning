Managing Complex Execution Strategies

Portfolio with hypothesis
-------------------------

A set of models is defined that can form a partial or complete
hypothesis to describe the problem. Also during the increase of the
experiments may change the model that best describes the existing
problem As a result, there is variability for each problem and
configuration step at the same time. A set of hypotheses can solve this
problem but it takes longer time for cross validation.

### Metrics

Keep making algorithmic progress toward the Pareto front in the
objective function space. Coefficient of determination (R2) is the wrong
indicator of success.

##### How evaluated a Pareto front?

-   Hypervolume (HV). This metric represents the volume of the objective
    space that is covered by the individuals of a non-dominated
    solutions set (solutions that belong to a Pareto front). The volume
    is delimited by two points: one point that is called the
    anti-optimal point (A) that is defined as the worst solution inside
    the objective space, and a second optimal point (pseudo-optimal)
    that is calculated by the proposed solution method.

-   Hyper-area Ratio (HR). The Hyper-area Ratio (HR) \[24\] employs the
    hypervolume of a solution set A divided by the hypervolume value of
    a Reference Front B. Higher values are preferred to lower ones.

-   Pareto Dominance Indicator (ER). Considers the solutions
    intersection between two given sets A and B, which can be provided
    by different algorithms or used to compare a solution set S with a
    Pareto Front P.

-   Crowding Distance

Variants in evaluation of sets of solutions for each hypothesis. Each
hypothesis have quality metrics. Solution(s) from each hypothesis have
also own metrics.

There are main approaches how produce single solution:

-   Solution from best hypothesis. Sorting

-   Bagging solution

-   Voting solution

##### Designing a Sampling Plan

\- The most straightforward way of sampling a design space in a uniform
fashion is by [@raw:EngSurMod] means of a rectangular grid of points. This
is the full factorial sampling technique referred - Latin Squares
