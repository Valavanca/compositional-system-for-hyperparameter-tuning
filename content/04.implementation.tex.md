### Metrics

Keep making algorithmic progress toward the Pareto front in the
objective function space

##### How evaluated a Pareto front?

\- Hypervolume - Hyper-area Ratio (HR) The Hyper-area Ratio (HR) \[24\]
employs the hypervolume of a solution set A divided by the hypervolume
value of a Reference Front B. Higher values are preferred to lower ones.

\- Pareto Dominance Indicator (ER) \[11\] considers the solutions
intersection between two given sets A and B, which can be provided by
different algorithms or used to compare a solution set S with a Pareto
Front P.

\- Crowding Distance

-   Solution from best hypothesis

-   Bagging solution

-   Voting solution
