Describe general objectives and there constraints

Parameter tuning
----------------

\- Single-obj optimization

Multi-objective optimization
----------------------------

\"Multi-objective optimization deals with such conflicting objectives.
It provides a mathematical framework to arrive at optimal design state
which accommodates the various criteria demanded by the application. The
process of optimizing systematically and simultaneously a collection of
objective functions are called multi-objective optimization
(MOO)[@raw:odugod2013]\". Thus, a central issue of MOO is the relationship
between the objective functions. These are usually modeled as
preferences of the decision maker.

Practical optimization problems usually involve simultaneous
optimization of multiple conflicting objectives with many
constraints(?).

-   Quality and Effort tradeoff for multi-objective

-   Human in the loop: Composition technic as tools for domain expert

##### Conclusion

For optimization expensive black-box:

-   Scalable algorithms that convert multi-objective to single objective
    problem produce solution that not accurate enough(Scalarizing). Also
    this approach suitable for a limited type of problem.

-   Genetic algorithms. This approach is costly to perform and not
    appropriate for expensive problems.

Optimization gap in obtaining high quality, multi/single-obj solutions
in expensive to evaluate experiments. Experiments as a black box,
derivative-free. Reference to surrogate optimization.

Surrogate optimization
----------------------

Surrogate used to expedite search for global optimum. Global accuracy of
surrogate not a priority

##### Use cases

Example for each type of optimization. Justification solution.
Conclusion: Design gap in optimization/parameter tuning. Need to
indicate optimization workflow for expensive process/experiments. The
argument(s) why we need new architecture. Reference to composition
architecture.

Compositional architecture
--------------------------

##### Interfaces and Contracts

##### Reusable software

Problem that each optimization framework/library use inner interfaces.
It is necessary to define a standard that implements best practices for
extension libraries [@raw:buitinck2013api].

Scope of work
-------------

\[\*\]make some nice diagram

Describe and implement workflow for multi-objective parameter tuning of
derivative free, black-box system. Parameter estimation is costly. The
proposed solutions are also suitable for single-criteria optimization.
