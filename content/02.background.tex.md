Describe general objectives and there constraints

Parameter tuning
----------------

\- Single-obj optimization

Multi-objective optimization
----------------------------

"The process of optimizing systematically and simultaneously a
collection of objective functions \[\...\]" \[88, p. 369\]Thus, A
central issue of MOO is the relationship between the objective
functions. These are usually modeled as preferences of the decision
maker.

Surrogate optimization
----------------------

Surrogate used to expedite search for global optimum. Global accuracy of
surrogate not a priority

##### Use cases

Example for each type of optimization.

Compositional architecture
--------------------------

##### Interfaces and Contracts

##### Reusable software

Problem that each optimization framework/library use inner interfaces.

Scope of work
-------------
