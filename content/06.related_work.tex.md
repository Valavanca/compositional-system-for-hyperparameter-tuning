============

Many existing approaches can be categorized as multi-objective
optimization. That is why introduce comparison criteria for a clear and
concise demarcation of the approach presented in this thesis,

Comparison Criteria for Related Work.

-   Hypothesis. What kind of hypothesis could be extrapolate on data.

-   Scalability. Add new algorithms. Variants on each optimization
    workflow step.

-   Adaptation. NFL

-   Parameter tuning. Experiments from 0 to n. The Sobol sequence.

Important Features: Categorical variables, prior knowledge,
multi-objective, feasibility constraints.
