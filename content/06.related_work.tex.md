============

Many existing approaches can be categorized as multi-objective
optimization. That is why introduce comparison criteria for a clear and
concise demarcation of the approach presented in this thesis:

Comparison Criteria for Related Work.

-   Variability. Exchange surrogate, solver and sampling algorithms as
    components. Variants on each optimization workflow step.

-   Scalability. Extend single-objective problem on the fly to
    multi-objective.

-   Adaptation. Surrogate portfolio.

-   From 0 to hero. Sampling plan depends on surrogate validity. The
    Sobol sequence (and Latin hypercube).

Important Features: Categorical variables, prior knowledge,
multi-objective, feasibility constraints.
