##### Intent:

Related work. The gaps of the others should be clearly Structure:

Comparison criteria

:   Surrogate type, Surrogate portfolio, Solver type, Sampling size,
    Many-objective optimization

Table

:   

Many existing approaches can be categorized as multi-objective
optimization. That is why introduce comparison criteria for a clear and
concise demarcation of the approach presented in this thesis:

Comparison Criteria for Related Work.

-   Variability. Exchange surrogate, solver and sampling algorithms as
    components. Variants on each optimization workflow step.

-   Scalability. Extend single-objective problem on the fly to
    multi-objective.

-   Adaptation. Surrogate portfolio.

-   From 0 to hero. Sampling plan depends on surrogate validity. The
    Sobol sequence (and Latin hypercube).

Important Features: Categorical variables, prior knowledge,
multi-objective, feasibility constraints.

##### ParEGO

ParEGO was enhanced to a multi-point proposal by increasing the number
of weight vectors randomly drawn in each iteration. If N points are
desired, cN (c &gt; 1) weight vectors are selected.
