Key description how to improve solutions for problems in research
questions.

Reduce effort for multi-obj prediction/solution
-----------------------------------------------

##### Surrogate model. Hypothesis as a middleware

Key idea is to use hypothesis model as middleware for genetic
multi-objective algorithms. This hypothesis could be compositional and
delineate target objectives.

Reusability in parameter tuning
-------------------------------

Parameter tuning can be splitted down into steps that are common for the
many/single-objective optimizations. Each step in optimization workflow
has variability via implemented interfaces. Single-objective hypotheses
can be combined for multi-objective optimization with compositional
design.

No free lunch theorem
---------------------

Hypothesis portfolio. +1 AutoML as self-adaptive hypothesis. +1 Scalable
bayesian optimization. Related with compositional design.

Range multi-objective solution
------------------------------

Multiple score metrics. R2 score on not-dominated test set.
