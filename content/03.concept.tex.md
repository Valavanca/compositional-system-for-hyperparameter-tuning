Concept
=======

Key description how to improve solutions for problems in research
questions.

reduce effort for multi-obj prediction/solution
-----------------------------------------------

\- Surrogate model. Hypothesis as a middleware

Reusability in parameter tuning
-------------------------------

\- Compositional design - Parameter tuning workflow/stages

No free lunch theorem
---------------------

\- Hypothesis portfolio. +1 AutoML as self-adaptive hypothesis. +1
Scalable bayesian optimization. Related with compositional design.

Range multi-objective solution
------------------------------

\- Multiple score metrics. R2 score on not-dominated test set.
