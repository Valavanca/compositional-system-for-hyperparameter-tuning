\chapter{Foundation}
    Describe general objectives and there constraints

    \section{Parameter tuning}
    - Single-obj optimization
    
    \section{Multi-objective optimization}
    "Multi-objective optimization deals with such conflicting objectives. It provides a
    mathematical framework to arrive at optimal design state which accommodates the various criteria demanded by
    the application. The process of optimizing systematically and simultaneously a collection of objective functions
    are called multi-objective optimization (MOO)\cite{odugod2013}".
    Thus, a central issue of MOO is the relationship between the objective functions. These are usually modeled as preferences of the decision maker.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quality and Effort tradeoff for multi-objective
        \item Human in the loop: Composition technic as tools for domain expert
    \end{itemize}

        \paragraph{Conclusion}
        For optimization expensive black-box:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Scalable algorithms that convert multi-objective to single objective problem produce solution that not accurate enough(Scalarizing). Also this approach suitable for a limited type of problem.
            \item Genetic algorithms. This approach is costly to perform and not appropriate for expensive problems.
        \end{itemize}
        Optimization gap in obtaining high quality, multi/single-obj solutions in expensive to evaluate experiments.
        Experiments as a black box, derivative-free. Reference to surrogate optimization.

    \section{Surrogate optimization}
    Surrogate used to expedite search for global optimum. Global accuracy of surrogate
    not a priority

        \paragraph{Use cases}
        Example for each type of optimization. Justification solution.
        Conclusion: Design gap in optimization/parameter tuning. 
        Need to indicate optimization workflow for expensive process/experiments. 
        The argument(s) why we need new architecture. Reference to composition architecture.

    \section{Compositional architecture}
        \paragraph{Interfaces and Contracts}

        \paragraph{Reusable software}
        Problem that each optimization framework/library use inner interfaces. 
        It is necessary to define a standard that implements best practices for extension libraries \cite{buitinck2013api}.

    \section{Scope of work}
        [*]make some nice diagram

        Describe and implement workflow for multi-objective parameter tuning of derivative free, black-box system. Parameter estimation is costly.
        The proposed solutions are also suitable for single-criteria optimization.
