\chapter{Foundation}
    Describe general objectives and there constraints

    \section{Parameter tuning}
    - Single-obj optimization
    
    \section{Multi-objective optimization}
    “The process of optimizing systematically and simultaneously a collection of objective functions [...]” [88, p. 369]Thus,
    A central issue of MOO is the relationship between the objective functions. These are usually modeled as preferences of the decision maker.

    \section{Surrogate optimization}
    Surrogate used to expedite search for global optimum. Global accuracy of surrogate
    not a priority

    \paragraph{Use cases}
    Example for each type of optimization.

    \section{Compositional architecture}
        \paragraph{Interfaces and Contracts}

        \paragraph{Reusable software}
        Problem that each optimization framework/library use inner interfaces.
