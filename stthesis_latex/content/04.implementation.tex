Managing Complex Execution Strategies

\section{Portfolio with hypothesis}
A set of models is defined that can form a partial or complete hypothesis to describe the problem.
Also during the increase of the experiments may change the model that best describes the existing problem
As a result, there is variability for each problem and configuration step at the same time. 
A set of hypotheses can solve this problem but it takes longer time for cross validation.

\section{Validate hypothesis}
    \epigraph{``All models are wrong but some are useful``}{\textit{â€“ George Box}}

    The main task of learning algorithms is to be able to generalize to unseen data. Surrogate model as learning model should generalize examples to valid hypothesis. 
    Since we cannot immediately check the surrogate performance on new, incoming data, it is necessary to sacrifice a small portion of the examples to check the quality of the model on it.
    n case if surrogate model have enoughs score (pass metrics threshold) we consider it valid and could be processed as subject for inference(prediction).

    \subsection{Sampling strategy}
    Oversampling and undersampling in data analysis. Alleviate imbalance in the dataset. 
    Imbalance in dataset is not always a problem, more so for optimization tasks. 

    The main gain for models not to provide best accuracy on all search space but provide possible optimum regions.
    Accuracy in prediction optimal regions or points from there will direct the search in the right direction.

    Predictor variables can legitimately over- or under-sample. 
    In this case, provided a carefully check that the model assumptions seem valid.
