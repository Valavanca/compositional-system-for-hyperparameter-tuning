    \subsection{Metrics}
        Keep making algorithmic progress toward the Pareto front in the objective function space
        \paragraph{How evaluated a Pareto front?}
            - Hypervolume
            - Hyper-area Ratio (HR)
            The Hyper-area Ratio (HR) [24] employs the hypervolume of a solution set A
            divided by the hypervolume value of a Reference Front B. Higher values are
            preferred to lower ones.

            - Pareto Dominance Indicator (ER) [11] considers the solutions intersection between two given sets A and B, which can be 
            provided by different algorithms or used to compare a solution set S with a Pareto Front P.

            - Crowding Distance
