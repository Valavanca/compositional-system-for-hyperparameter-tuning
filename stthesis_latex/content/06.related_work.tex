\chapter{Related work}
    Many existing approaches can be categorized as multi-objective optimization. That is why
    introduce comparison criteria for a clear and concise demarcation of the approach presented in this thesis, 

    Comparison Criteria for Related Work. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hypothesis. What kind of hypothesis could be extrapolate on data.
        \item Scalability. Add new algorithms. Variants on each optimization workflow step.
        \item Adaptation. NFL
        \item Parameter tuning. Experiments from 0 to n. The Sobol sequence.                
    \end{itemize}
    Important Features: Categorical variables, prior knowledge, multi-objective, feasibility constraints.
