\chapter{Concept}
Key description how to improve solutions for problems in research questions.

    \section{Reduce effort for multi-obj prediction/solution}
        \paragraph{Surrogate model. Hypothesis as a middleware}
        Key idea is to use hypothesis model as middleware for genetic multi-objective algorithms.
        This hypothesis could be compositional and delineate target objectives. 



    \section{Reusability in parameter tuning}
        Parameter tuning can be splitted down into steps that are common for the many/single-objective optimizations. 
        Each step in optimization workflow has variability via implemented interfaces.
        Single-objective hypotheses can be combined for multi-objective optimization with compositional design.

    \section{No free lunch theorem}
        Hypothesis portfolio. +1 AutoML as self-adaptive hypothesis. +1 Scalable bayesian optimization. Related with compositional design.

    \section{Range multi-objective solution}
        Multiple score metrics. R2 score on not-dominated test set.
