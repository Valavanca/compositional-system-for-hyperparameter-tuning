\chapter{Concept}
Key description how to improve solutions for problems in research questions.

    \section{Reduce effort for multi-obj prediction/solution}
        - Surrogate model. Hypothesis as a middleware

    \section{Reusability in parameter tuning}
        - Compositional design
        - Parameter tuning workflow/stages 

    \section{No free lunch theorem}
        - Hypothesis portfolio. +1 AutoML as self-adaptive hypothesis. +1 Scalable bayesian optimization. Related with compositional design.

    \section{Range multi-objective solution}
        - Multiple score metrics. R2 score on not-dominated test set.
